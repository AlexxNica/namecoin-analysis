plot resurrections vs. time period after expires [done]
Add time data points for change in expire time [done]

statistics on names currently registered
        -like 60% are in alexa top mil (they aren't)

explain what types of names are taken (current domains)
    -dirty
    -alexa
    -drugs
    -brute force short names (not in dic)
    -dictionary words  
    -long random char strings



Papers Notes:
    insight on introduction:
    -why are squatters bad? (our disc eariler for readers benefit)
    -why are we studying namecoin?
        -namecoin doesn't want to be a currency
        -namecoin was the first
        -use blockchain tech for something other than a currency
        -key/value store makes it a platform for other applications
        -usability cost of using d/ vs oneName
        -what if namecoin was free?
        -economic argument about OneName
            -why it works?
            -etc.
    -other alt coins doing things other than currency? with users?
        -if no, can make the claim that blockchains might not be good for 
    -methodological contributions
    -how valuable a name is (estimate parameters: name length, content, did it expire?, when registered, has legit value)
        -numerical score based on observables
        -try to estimate weights of input values
        -WHAT LETS YOU PREDICT THE VALUE OF A DOMAIN?
        -about methodology, not results
            -rigorous


explain decision on what to res-- could contribute to model

==================================================================================

-need a formal model
-assumptions needed about a namespace
    -assume the value of different names is different
    -names also have different values to different people (food.com is equally valuable to all)
        -(utility function?)
    -reveals complexity in the market
    -squatting is a problem because: 
        -market for buying and selling domain names is inefficient
        -search costs
        -not achieving welfare maximization
        -the value of a domain that a squatter owns may increase in value if a new buyer starts using the system, or becomes
            aware that they want a certain name
        -inherent inefficiency in the market because a squatter needs to predict if the name will increase in value in the
            future, vs selling it right now
    -ideally each name should go to who ever has the most utility for a name
    -consider model where cost to register a name is an asymptotically decreasing to zero function
    -claim:this is the same as a first price auction    

    -network effect: value of network is quadratically related to the number of participants
        -people who adopt have an interest in getting others to adopt
    -squatter delima: selling a domain can increase the value of the rest of their domains
        -but they lose this domain for essentially 0 profit
      -all the squatters hope someone else will help bootstrap the system for their benefit
        -tradegedy of the commons 
        -total monopoly? then you know you can't count on others -> know you need to do the bootstraping
        -monopoly works, forced diversity works-- problem in the middle
    -put the unix dictionary statistic into the paper
        

    -interesting idea: what if the names are locked to a key? can't sell, trade-- what if it doesn't expire?
        -lose the ability to differentiate price of different domains

    -could offer mapping the design space
        -design choices (can do A or not A)

============================================================================================
2/27
    -3 parts left-- empirical part (data collection), mapping design space, and writing
    -analyze content in corpus we collected (out of reachable websites with content)
        -look for content duplication
    ->put table into paper with (abstract? get the readers attention that we take 200,000 to 7):
     
    Total key value pairs: 191,000     
    Possibly valid DNS: 17,000
    Unique: ?? ~6000
    Curl: almost same^ 
    
    Knock off stuff with:
        not a redirect: removes a few hundred
        squatter filtering
        de-dup IPs: removes about 5,000 (leaving 1k)
            -of those, how many are on a hosting site etc
        expired, errors, etc: 
        looked through to remove ones with a normal TLD variant 
        -> put in paper stats on who has the same domain name on a different TLD vs same
        down to 77 domains
            -size heuristic to remove small domains (based on content)

    ->add limitations section describing that there could be interesting results we missed

    ->put in paper: list of possible values for .bit (like IPv6, NS IP, NS, etc)
    -small scale test to verify that pinging NS via open nick was working
    -look into policies of hosting sites for different TLDs
        ->put into paper, how to host-- you need to cal a hosting service
         to manually allow .bit

    Map out design space for namecoin alternative fees:

    Cost to a user for taking and using a name
        3 types of fees:
            -miner
            -burn
            -escrow
    Challenge of pricing schemes based on changing price of namecoin
        -denominated in external currency
      Different Price Method Tree
        times when you pay (potentially):
            -1st registration
                -set by auction
                    -timing of auctions
                        (splitting auctions into these categories-> useful?)
                        -trigger mechanism
                        -periodicity
                            -a person potentially interested in a large number of domains would need 
                             to constantly by ready to bid without this
                -set by system
                    -domain dependent (like length)?
                        -oracle
                    -globally fixed
                    -time dependent 
                    -size dependence
            -update
            -renewal
                -auctions on renewals
            -challenge
                Reasons for challenge:
                    -two parties have utility for a name (highest economic utility)
                    -some entity doesn't want a user to have a domain (prevent seizure)
                  (difference between positive and negative utility)
            
    -oracle with predictive model-- guesses price based on price of past domains


    -machine learning thing to predict price
        -machine learning: regression-- x is data about the name
                                        y is data about "value"
                                        "value" is composed of it's history and stuff
                    think--> get inherent value of the name itself!!

        Scoring function:

              [x]  #times re-registered
                jesus gap
                is latest value JSON/valid looking dns record
                fraction of time active
                # of changes to value
                alive now?
              [x] fraction of time dead

            linear combination? 
            consider forcing ranking to make sure  the entire score space is used
            MAP (mean average precision)
             
                score = sum_i (N-r_i)/N  binary values contribute 0 or 1/2 to the score

            -try to learn how much of the value is controlled by the different factors
                (alexa causes 30% of value, etc etc)
            
Paper:
    -put methodology with results
    -maybe put number of name sales in abstract?

    Structure/sections of the paper:

            -lack of evidence of people trading names

            -1 assumptions inherent
            -2 analysis of domains
            -3 analysis of market
            -4 modeling of value
            -5 thoughts on design space

            -value features (features are the ones we identified for the piechart-ish):
                -common-ness of words
                
=======================================================
3/2

use proper technical terminology
    -dns lookup
    -frontrunning
        -name new mechanism only needed in some designs
differentiate mechanism design
    -differentiate between economics/crypto etc.
        -separate

change claim about squatters having same value in their name/values
    -heuristic, but good because it is a bound

atomic transaction 
    -diagram

=======================================================
practical reasons why users don;t use namecoin
trust agility
    -having multiple authorities allows people to move from one to the other
        -increases security
    -well recognized intermediate level of security
