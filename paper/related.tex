The block chain has been proposed as a stratum for building technologies and mechanisims beyond storing financial transactions. CommitCoin proposes putting hash commitments on the Bitcoin block chain in order to accurately timestamp some piece of information~\cite{clark2012commitcoin}. Hash commitments appear in the Namecoin protocol for registering new names. In  \cite{bonneau2014decentralizing} the authors describe how to use the block chain to create prediction markets and order books.
