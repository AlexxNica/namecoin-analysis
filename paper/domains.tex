\section{Analysis of .bit domains}

In this section we analyze the current state of .bit domains. We explore the system on multiple levels. We begin at the highest level, looking at the repetition of values in order to detect squatters. Next we look at how many .bit domains are set up with queryable values. Finally we actually visit these querable names and analyze the content we find there.

\subsection{Detecting Squatters}

We investigate the balance between squatters and other users in the .bit subspace. As we discussed in \ref{sec:model}, namespace squatting is an important issue to understand. We look at Namecoin in order to get a realistic view on the proliferation of squatting.

  \label{fig:percentSquatter}
\end{figure}

Namecoin possesses the same pseudonymity properties as Bitcoin and thus it is difficult to group names by their owner. Names are owned by individual addresses rather than by identities and it is common practice to keep each purchased name under a different address. Thus it is difficult to assess how many names a single person owns. 

However, many squatters are easily identified through the values they set on names they own. Since there is no built-in functionality for the listing and sale of names in Namecoin, squatters use the values of names they own to display contact information. This information generally comes in the form of either contact information stored directly in the value of a name, or contact information stored on the IP address to which the name resolves.  We observed that a squatter's contact information is generally constant among all the names he owns. Thus, by measuring the extent of duplication values on the blockchain, we can estimate the rate of squatters compared to regular users.

Regular .bit domain owners are unlikely to use values that are highly replicated. The value of a domain points to the individual server and owner and thus must be mostly unique. The only repetition that may occur in this circumstance is when multiple names resolve at the same point. This could occur when a single DNS server is resolving a large number of names to different websites. However from our analysis in Section \ref{domainbreakdown}, we see that this does not happen currently.

There is no clear method for deciding exactly how often a value has to occur in order to assume a squatter has been detected. However even the coarsest grained approach displays the massive amount of squatting on the blockchain. Simply observing the 196023 currently active names, reveals that there are only 34361 unique values.

In figure \ref{fig:percentSquatter} we examine the fraction of current .bit names are squatted. We sorted all of the values that occur by the number of times they occur. 
%As the graph threshold moves along the X-axis, the sum of only values that occur more than $n$ times is show. 
The graph has a very sharp initial drop as we remove all names with values that occur only a few times. This leaves the majority of domains to drop off very slowly as we remove bigger and bigger squatters. Using a cut-off of $n=$\hi{[fill in]}, it appears safe to say that at least 70\% of .bit domains are held by squatters.

\subsection{DNS Records}

\begin{table}[t]
\begin{tabular}{ll}
Type of Resolution & Count \\ \hline
Nameserver URL     & 3359  \\
Nameserver IP      & 175   \\
Single IP          & 6304  \\
Multiple IP        & 3     \\
Single IPv6        & 3     \\
Multiple IPv6      & 1     \\
Tor                & 12    \\
Alias              & 27    \\
Only Subdomains    & 135   \\ \hline
Total              & 10019
\end{tabular}
\caption{.bit domain resolution methods}
\end{table}

We now examine how .bit domains are used by legitimate users. Only 10019 out of the 141422 .bit domains make any attempt to resolve to IP addresses. Out of these a variety of types of IP resolution are employed.

In order to support DNS lookups, Namecoin provides a specification that allows for the support of most DNS record types. A name's configuration is stored in a JSON dictionary object which is placed in a name's value. Domain's can be configured in a number of different ways. The main methods are directly setting one of more IP (or IPv6) addresses or setting one or more secondary name-servers which hold information about a domain. Additionally records can link a name to a number of hidden services like .onion\cite{onion} and .i2p\cite{i2p}.

Namecoin supports a number of different name resolution methods. Different methods have different properties and thus it is interesting to inspect how people are setting up their domains. The vast majority of people are pointing their domains directly to an address. This includes people using IP, IPv6, and Tor. This is by far the most secure method since the IP address is protected directly with blockchain security. A user can simply look up a name in the blockchain and immediately be linked to a server. However, this security comes at the cost of flexibility since the server is directly encoded in the blockchain. and can not be changed without an update.


%insecure delegation like DNSSEC
% cite DNS lookup attack
The much more flexible configuration, used by a large number of people as well, is name server delegation. Rather than directly listing an IP address in the blockchain, one or more name servers are listed. This way a name owner can update it's IP address without modifying the blockchain. However this is insecure delegation since Namecoin can not enforce any security properties regarding the action of the external name server. Additionally if a name server is listed with a hostname rather than and IP address, a standard DNS lookup must occur, linking Namecoin with standard DNS.

\subsection{Domain Content Analysis}
\label{domainbreakdown}

\begin{table}[t]
\begin{tabular}{ll}
Valid DNS          &  10019  \\
Curlable        & 5374     \\
Not Squatter        & 745     \\
Without Duplicates      & 455     \\
Without Errors              & 278    \\
With Content              & 223    \\
Without ICANN hostname   & 29   \\
\end{tabular}
\caption{Reduction of domains to real content}
\end{table}

After understanding how people connect their names with IP addresses, we now explore what sorts of content is reachable through .bit domain names. We attempted to download the www front page of each of these 10019 domains over port 80 (http). 4546 of these domains were unreachable or didn't serve web content leaving us with only 5374 domains which present any response.

At this point we moved to looking at the content of server responses. Immediately noticeable was the fact that 4629 of these names pointed came from 3 different squatters. These domains held nothing of value and caused massive inflation in our reachable domain count.

Without the squatters, we had 745 viable domains. However many of these pages included identical content which does not add value to the system after removed 290 of such duplicates we had 455 domains left.

At this point we started inspecting the actual content of the webpages. A large number of them were either error responses from the server or default pages from various servers. Neither of these types of pages are usable content. Removing the 177 of these left us with 278 domains.

Out of the remaining sites, many had very small amounts of content consisting of only a few words on a blank page like, "Welcome to mysite.bit." These pages, though valid uses of Namecoin, do not provide any utility to a visitor. Thus we decided to look at only pages consisting of 14 or more words and images which brought us down to 223 pages.

These 223 pages make up the only websites reachable through .bit domain names which have real content on them at the time of this analysis. This represents the value of .bit domains to people who can visit them today. We are further interested in the subset of these pages which don't come from a server that is accessible through a standard ICANN TLD as well.  83 of the pages directly redirect the user to a standard domain and 111 were manually identified as pointing to the same site as a standard domain.

We finished our analysis with 29 pages remaining. These pages represent the .bit unique content available.

Our approach to analyzing content suffers from a few limitations. First of all we only queried the main domain over port 80, thus if any of the servers only respond to subdomains or only serve content over HTTPS, they are not included. Additionally when we detect how much content is on each page, we do not follow links and thus content could be hidden behind links. However despite this limitations we believe that we have missed very few legitimate domains.

\subsection{Categorizing Squatter Name Decisions}

As we have seen, many individual squatters buy up very large numbers of domains. We now explore what sort of categories these names fall into and through this try to interpret the decisions these squatters have made. Surprisingly squatters do no follow many obvious strategies of name selection.
